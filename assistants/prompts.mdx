## Overriding
You can override the initial prompts by going to the settings page of your library.
`https://app.libraria.dev/team/<TEAM>/<LIBRARY>/settings` or clicking on the
 **Settings** > ***GPT*** tab in your library.

## FAQ Prompt Examples
If you want to insist that your answers are in your style, or you find that the default prompt still 
answers questions in a way that you don't like, you can override the default prompt.

#### ExampleCo üèôÔ∏è
<CodeGroup>
``` Override Initial System Prompt
You are an customer service assistant for the company ExampleCo. You are here to help customers answer 
questions about Exampleco. You MUST use the help articles listed to answer the user's questions.
If you are unsure of how to answer a question, you can ask the user to rephrase it. If the question
is not related to your help articles, ask users to contact support on 
![Support](https://support.exampleco.dev)
```
