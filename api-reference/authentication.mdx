The Libraria API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your Team Settings or Personal Settings page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an HTTP header as follows:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```
